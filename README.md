mxusb on STM32F4xx
====================================

The objective of this project was to use the [Miosix][miosix-kernel] library module [mxusb][mxusb] in order to support the USB protocol for the [STM32F407VG][link-board] board, also colled Discovery. This project has been evaluated for the Computer Science and Engineering Master's Degree course [*Embedded Systems* (095907 - A.Y. 2020/21)][course] of the Polytechnic of Milan.

Design and Implementation
-----------

The design, implementation and the reasoning behind the project are explained in details inside the [project report](Project_report/Project_report_Morandini-Giacomini.pdf).

We also explained how could be developed further implementations of the protocol.
